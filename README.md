# Dog-Breed-Classifier

> This is project #2 in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.
The goal of this project is to design a Dog Breed Classifier that if the input image is of a dog, the output would be of the predicted breed (total of 133 breeds) and if the input image is of a human, the output would be of the breed that this human looks like predicted by the model.
